Hi, all! Welcome to my webpage. 

I am currently a second-year Master of Science in Computer Science (MS CS) student at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). I am also a graduate research assistant (GRA) at the UT CS vision group headed by [Prof. Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/grauman/). My current areas of research with Prof. Grauman include audio-visual navigation and learning with embodied agents. At a high level, I have been working on two key audio-visual tasks -- audiogoal navigation and active audio separation.

Previously, I served as a research assistant at the [Center for Computation and Cognition (CCC)](http://www.ccc.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/), Goethe University in Frankfurt under the supervision of [Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SS10xIgAAAAJ&hl=en) from start of 2018 until the middle of 2019. My research back then focused on investigating systems that have the ability to learn multiple tasks continually in tandem, and how Bayesian inference and prediction confidence estimation techniques can be leveraged for such continual learning systems. Prior to that, I was working on automated neural architecture search algorithms and their application to multi-label image classification tasks. I also got the opportunity to work with [Prof. Christoph Malsburg](https://www.fias.science/en/neuroscience/research-groups/christoph-von-der-malsburg/) at the [Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS)](https://fias.institute/en/) and build some vision models that don't rely on training with 'big data'. Basically, they are human-brain-inspired neural models of vision that learn and function through mutual excitations and inhibitions of neural connections while having access to limited training data. Even before that, I had spent four wonderful years at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani) before graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electronics and Instrumentation in July 2018.
