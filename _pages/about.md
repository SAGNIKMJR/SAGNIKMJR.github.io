I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) in Electronics and Instrumentation from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani in July 2018. I am currently serving as a research assistant at the [Center for Computation and Cognition (CCC)](http://www.ccc.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/), Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Goethe University in Frankfurt under the supervision of [Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SS10xIgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mr. Martin Mundt](http://martin-mundt.com/). 

My current interests are investigating algorithms for better and more efficient machine learning (ML) that can be practically applied to diverse computer vision tasks. I am also keen to work on systems that have the ability to handle multiple tasks in parallel or in tandem. Such systems require mechanisms for the retainment and transfer of old learned knowledge. They offer a tremendous potential for transfer and continuous learning research. I believe that current ML systems can be made more efficient by reducing their trainnig data requirements and that confidence estimation through Bayesian inference can be a way to address this issue. Besides, I have also gained some experience of building human-brain-inspired neural models of vision that have the ability to learn through mutual excitations and inhibitions of neural connections while having access to limited training data (read 'not big data!').

### Broad research areas
* Meta-learning and continuous learning
* Deep reinforcement learning
* Bayesian inference
* Deep learning in computer vision
* Principled cognitive models of perception
